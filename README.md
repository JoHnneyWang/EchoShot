## 📝 Intro
__This is the official Github page of EchoShot, the code has been released at [D2I-ai](https://github.com/D2I-ai/EchoShot). Though, you can still refer to the instructions in this repo to fully experience EchoShot__. It allows users to generate multiple video shots showing the same person, controlled by customized prompts. Currently it supports text-to-multishot portrait video generation. Hope you have fun with this demo!

## 🔔 News
- July 15, 2025: 🔥 EchoShot-1.3B-preview is now available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/JonneyWang/EchoShot)!
- July 15, 2025: 🎉 __Release official inference and training codes at [D2I-ai](https://github.com/D2I-ai/EchoShot).__
- May 25, 2025: We propose [EchoShot](https://johnneywang.github.io/EchoShot-webpage/), a multi-shot portrait video generation model.


## ⚙️ Installation
### Prepare Code
First, use this code to download codes from [D2I-ai](https://github.com/D2I-ai/EchoShot):

    git clone https://github.com/D2I-ai/EchoShot
    cd EchoShot

### Construct Environment
Use this code to install the required packages:

    conda create -n echoshot python=3.10
    conda activate echoshot
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Download Model
Since EchoShot is based on Wan2.1, you have to first download Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B using:

    pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
    huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B --local-dir .models/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B

Then download the EchoShot model:

    huggingface-cli download JonneyWang/EchoShot --local-dir ./models/EchoShot

### Organize Files
We recommend to organize local directories as:
```angular2html
EchoShot
├── ...
├── dataset
│   |── video
|   |   ├── 1.mp4
|   |   ├── 2.mp4
|   |   └── ...
|   └── train.json
├── models
│   |── Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B
│   |   └── ...
│   └── EchoShot
|       ├── EchoShot-1.3B-preview.pth
|       └── ...
└── ...
```

## 🎬 Usage
#### Inference
For optimal performance, we highly recommend using LLM for prompt extension. We provide a Dashscope API usage for extension:
- Use the Dashscope API for extension.
  - Apply for a `dashscope.api_key` in advance ([EN](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/getting-started/first-api-call-to-qwen) | [CN](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/first-api-call-to-qwen)).
  - Configure the environment variable `DASH_API_KEY` to specify the Dashscope API key. For users of Alibaba Cloud's international site, you also need to set the environment variable `DASH_API_URL` to 'https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1'. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [dashscope document](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/developer-reference/use-qwen-by-calling-api?spm=a2c63.p38356.0.i1).
  - Use the `qwen-plus` model for extension.

You can specify the DASH_API_KEY and other important configs in [generate.sh](./generate.sh). Then run this code to start sampling:
```
bash generate.sh
```
#### Train
If you want to train your own version of the model, please prepare the dataset, which should include video files and their corresponding JSON files. Here, we provide an example in [dataset/train.json](./dataset/train.json) for reference. All training configurations are stored in [config_train.py](./config_train.py), where you can make specific modifications according to your needs. Once everything is set up, execute the following code to start the training process:
```
bash train.sh
```
